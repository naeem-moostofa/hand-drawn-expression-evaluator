Handwritten Expression Evaluator

## Project Description

Two neural networks were created from scratch using the numpy library and trained to recognize numerical digits and mathamatical operations. These networks were trained on the MNIST dataset and mathematical symbols from: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clarencezhao/handwritten-math-symbol-dataset](url), the two networks have an accuracy of 88% and 76% respectively. The tkinter library was used to create an interface where users can draw an expression which is reconized and evaluated using the two models. The two models are saved using the pickle library.
